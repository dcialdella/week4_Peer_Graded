# Introduction

The script `run_analysis.R` will perform the 5 steps definited.

Lines 18 - 30
prepare Libraries and PROXY to download file from internet

Lines 40 - 93
download file if don't exists and un-compress to create folder with data inside

100 - 108
obtain activities and subjects, needed for processing

119 big part, identify numbers with chars "MEAN" or "STD", isolate IDs needed for other process

127 - 137
obtain subjects from TEST and TRAINING data, bind both to a big object (titulo_data)

150 - 162
load data from tables TRAIN and TESTING, parts X and Y (take care of "y" and NOT "Y"

170 - 178
Join/Bind data from X, and Y isolated each one

183 another big part (real strange)
review the 2nd columnd in caracteristics and use it as Field name

188 - 192
prepare field name to the joining (future)

195 Join all and make a big object, may be needed for other tasks

208 DDPLY big part, two hours to identify this solution
how use col names, calculate mean, different V1/subjects

215 Write tidy.txt file
generate a local file, no names, just info.
